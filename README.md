This recreation of the popular game snake is very simple.

The user moves around using the WASD keys, as the player eats the fruit the tail of the snake gets longer. If the player hits the head of the snake on any of the borders the game is over. 
If the player hits the head of the snake to any part of the snakes body the game is over as well.

There is also a score tracker in the bottom of the screen.
